# Get Started

Learn how to add onramps and crypto purchases to your application. Refer to our [integrations overview](connect/pay/overview#integration-options) to see which integration is right for you.

The following guide uses thirdweb TypeScript SDK. You can also integrate Pay with thirdweb's [Unity SDK](/unity/pay/getbuywithcryptoquote).

## Install the Connect SDK

<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i thirdweb"
	yarn="yarn install thirdweb"
	pnpm="pnpm i thirdweb"
/>

## Get your Client ID

Log in to [the thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard). Navigate to the **Settings** page and create an API key to get your **Client ID**. You'll need your Client ID to interact with the Connect SDK.
