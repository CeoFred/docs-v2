# External Wallets

thirdweb supports a number of first-party web3 wallets such as Metamask and Phantom. You can view the full list of [supported wallets here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5/supported-wallets).

The easiest way to add wallet connection to your application is via the [ConnectButton](https://www.notion.so/ConnectButton-51113a400e614dfe93a598e9e1b8ef63?pvs=21). To configure the wallets shown to your users, you can add them to the ConnectButton `wallets` prop with its [wallet ID](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5/supported-wallets).

ℹ️ External wallet login methods can also be configured from the [Connect Playground](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/connect/playground) in the thirdweb dashboard.
