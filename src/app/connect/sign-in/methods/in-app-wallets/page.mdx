# Email & Phone Number Sign-In

Users can sign in through Connect via a one-time password sent to their email or SMS.

For both OTP login methods, thirdweb generates a non-custodial in-app wallet behind the scenes within your application. In-app wallets enable your users to interact with your application, as well as store tokens and assets they receive while interacting with your application.


ℹ️ OTP login methods can be configured from the Connect Playground in the thirdweb dashboard.



The easiest way to enable email & phone number login in your application is with our ConnectButton component:

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
 
const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: your_client_id });

const wallets = [
  inAppWallet({
    providers: ["email", "phone"],
  }),
];
 
export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectButton client={client} wallets={wallets} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

## Phone Number First Sign In

By default, email login is displayed before phone number login within Connect. If you’d like to present phone number first, ensure that `"phone"` is listed first in the `wallets` providers array, like so:

```tsx
const wallets = [
  inAppWallet({
    providers: ["phone", "email"],
  }),
];
```

## **Interacting with your App**

Once a user signed in and their wallet is generated, you can use the **[Wallet Connection hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/hooks#wallet-connection)** to get information about the connected wallet like getting the address, account, and more.
