# ConnectButton

The `ConnectButton` component unlocks all of thirdweb’s login, onboarding, and blockchain interaction capabilities via a customizable and secure interface.

It offers users secure login methods with email, phone, socials, and external wallets. Once signed-in, users are able to send and receive funds to their account, purchase crypto with onramps, and execute transactions within the application.

## Install the Connect SDK

```tsx
npm i thirdweb
```

## Get Your Client ID

Log in to [the thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard). Navigate to the **Settings** page and create an API key to get your **Client ID**.

## Initialize the ConnectButton

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: your_client_id });

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectButton client={client} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

## Configuring Login Methods

Once you’ve initialized your `ConnectButton`, you can configure the `wallets` prop to enable connection with [email and phone number, social apps like Google and Facebook, and external wallets such as Metamask and Phantom.

## Props

The ConnectButton component has a number of configurable props. [View full reference](/references/typescript/v5/ConnectButtonProps).
