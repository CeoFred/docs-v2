# ConnectEmbed

The `ConnectEmbed` component renders the same modal interface as the [ConnectButton](/connect/sign-in/get-started/ConnectButton), allowing you to place your Connect flow directly in your page without an overlay. The `ConnectEmbed` is more useful for implementing full page sign in flows.

## Install the Connect SDK

```tsx
npm i thirdweb
```

## Get Your Client ID

Log in to [the thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard). Navigate to the **Settings** page and create an API key to get your **Client ID**.

## Initialize the ConnectEmbed

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectEmbed } from "thirdweb/react";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: your_client_id });

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectEmbed client={client} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

## Configuring Login Methods

Once you’ve initialized your `ConnectButton`, you can configure the `wallets` prop to enable connection with email and phone number, social apps like Google and Facebook, and external wallets like Metamask and Phantom.

## Props

The ConnectEmbed component has a number of configurable props. [View full reference](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/ConnectEmbedProps).
